# Toroid - the first Uncollateralized Stable Token

An existing pseudo-commodity and a smart contracts framework allow
the creation of a purely automatic and self-sufficient price-stable cryptocurrency,
without human intervention. This new currency, we denominated
Toroid1
or TRD, can be used more extensively for commerce than
pseudo commodity cryptocurrencies due to its lower volatility. Also, is
suitable for investment, as the tokens in each account multiply, return interest,
when the market grows. Like the controlled fiat money of a central
bank plus the benefits of an inflation-adjusted perpetuity bond. It eliminates
the need of debt as the basic mechanism of the economy, although
allows banking and further lending on top of it. Collateral in base coin, for
example BTC or ETH, can be added to bootstrap your own Toroid investment
or withdrawed after a very small investment period. So, the Toroids
are not created from nothing nor have a limited monetary base. The
minimum investment period can be very small, for example one day, and
you keep the interest but you can return the Toroids and refund your collateral.
That is a one-side only peg to a deflationary crypto-commodity.
The stability is guaranteed by endogenous measurements of number of
transactions and wallet pro-rated rebasement of balance to reduce volatility
of price. Each account has its own rebasement due to the account
creation timestamp. Rebasement control mechanism is progressive during
initial bootstrap period because price manipulation protection is more
severe when the capital involved is smaller. Rebasement has a quick positive
start to incentivize early adopters that see only big growth in their
TRD account during bootstrap period. Finally, the new rebasement control
makes it economically infeasible for an attacker targeting the coin
with manipulated transaction volume if we set the minimum rebasement
greater than profits from massive currency manipulation. This protection
increases its robustness and effectiveness over time because a coin with
bigger capitalization is more difficult to manipulate.
